envs:
  # Root/production environment
  root:
    prefix: enva-root
    aws_profile: root
    color: teal
    region: eu-west-1
    description: Production environment

#
# 1. Copy this file to ~/.config/axium/envs.yaml
#
# 2. Customize the environments and properties for your setup
#
# 3. Set the active environment:
#    $ axium env set root
#
# 4. View available environments:
#    $ axium env list
#
